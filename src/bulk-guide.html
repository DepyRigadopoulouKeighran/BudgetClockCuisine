              Cooking in Bulk : A Step By Step Guide
            </h3>
            <p class="bulk-guide-main-txt">
              Bulk cooking can take the form of preparing substantial quantities
              of various ingredients that can be mixed and matched, or crafting
              generous portions of specific mixed dishes, such as lasagna or
              casseroles. We'll delve deeper into these variations later on.
              Regardless of your chosen approach, there are key steps to embark
              upon:

            <p class="bulk-guide-txt">
              Begin by determining the number of meals you aim to create for the
              week and the corresponding recipes. Your choice hinges on whether
              you opt for the mix-and-match style of batch cooking or prefer to
              focus on a couple of larger mixed dishes. For inspiration, our
              Foodal platform offers an array of recipes tailor-made for batch
              cooking. Additionally, Pinterest and Google searches can yield
              fresh bulk cooking ideas, often featuring sale items, seasonal
              ingredients, and pantry staples. Grains bowls, sheet pan meals,
              and pasta dishes align well with the mix-and-match approach.
              Meanwhile, larger batches of mixed dishes like lasagna, enchilada
              casseroles, chili, and soup work wonders.

              With your culinary plans in place, it's time to put pen to paper.
              Group your grocery items according to their location within the
              store to streamline your shopping experience. Sticking to your
              list ensures you buy what you need without excess waste. Keep an
              eye out for discounted staples like olive oil, spices, canned
              goods, and grains. Remember to shop your own pantry first – you
              can utilize rice, beans, lentils, and frozen ingredients that are
              already stocked. Additionally, make use of stored frozen fruits,
              vegetables, and grains.

              Equipped with your ingredients, it's time to dive in! Choose a day

              while enjoying a movie or sports game.
