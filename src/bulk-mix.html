            <p>
              When aiming to savor a diverse array of flavors during the week
              without expanding your grocery list excessively, crafting
              mix-and-match meals presents an ideal solution. This approach
              centers on preparing one or two grains, proteins, a variety of
              vegetables, and multiple sauces. These components can then be
              artfully combined to create distinct meals. While certain core
              ingredients remain constant, the key lies in having an assortment
              of sauces, cheeses, or spice blends that provide distinctive
              flavor profiles to each meal. My preferred combination blueprint
              is as follows:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="p-2">
            <p class="d-flex justify-content-center my-mix-match-txt">
              - 2 Protein Choices: beef, chicken, tofu, chickpeas, fish, etc.
              <br />
              - 2 Carbohydrate Options: brown rice, quinoa, farro, whole wheat
              pasta, whole wheat tortillas, sweet potatoes, etc.
              <br />
              - A Selection of Sauces: peanut sauce, barbecue, teriyaki,
              marinara, green curry, salsa, etc.
              <br />
              - An Assortment of Vegetables: including leafy greens and roasted
              root vegetables, among others.
            </p>

            <p>
              In instances where time is tight, opting for a bag of pre-mixed
              fresh vegetables works splendidly.
              <br />
              Alternatively, choose in-season or on-sale produce for added
              variety. Once you've pinpointed your selections in each category,
              it's time to cook and prepare ample quantities.
              <br />
              The quantity depends on the number of meals you intend to prepare
              in advance for the week and the servings required per meal. From
              there, you have two choices: store the components separately for
              mixing and matching throughout the week, or pre-portion them in
              containers on Sunday for effortless access.

            <h4>MIX-AND-MATCH PREP SAMPLE MENU COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:</h4>
            <p>
              <span> <i>STEP 1 - START WITH THE GRAINS</i> </span>
              <br />
              Cook farro on the stovetop, or use a rice cooker or Instant Pot.
              Roast sweet potatoes in the oven or steam/microwave as an
              alternative.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span><i>STEP 2 - COOK VEGETABLES AND PROTEINS</i> </span>
              <br />
              Toss chopped vegetables in oil, salt, and pepper, then roast in
              the oven. Stir-fry tofu and chicken on the stove or roast them
              alongside the vegetables (using separate baking sheets if
              necessary).
              <br />
              <br />
              <span
                ><i>STEP 3 - PREPARE UNCOOKED COMPONENTS AND INITIATE CLEANUP</i> </span
              >
              <br />
              While cooking, drain and rinse canned beans if necessary. Prepare
              sauces (like peanut sauce) and begin tidying up.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span><i>STEP 4 - COOL, ADD EXTRAS, AND STORE</span></i>
              <br />
              Once cooked, you can store each component separately or
              pre-portion the meals. Items such as cheese, avocado slices,
              yogurt, or sour cream, as well as spice blends, can be added
              during portioning or just before eating. Ensure all ingredients
              cool to room temperature before storing in the fridge or freezer.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span><i>MIXED-DISH MEALS </i> </span>
              <br />
              Bulk cooking is also applicable to mixed-dish meals like
              enchiladas, chili, and casseroles. Prepare a substantial batch of
              one or two recipes, freeze them in individual portions, and enjoy
              the convenience of pre-cooked meals ready for thawing and
              reheating. This approach is advantageous for utilizing sale items
              or ingredients nearing expiration. For instance, making two trays
              of lasagna when ricotta is on sale offers a week's meal along with
              slices stored in the freezer for future consumption.

            <h4>TO EXCEL IN LARGE-BATCH MIXED-DISH COOKING:</h4>
            <p>
              1. Choose recipes with overlapping ingredients to save time and
              expenses.
              <br />
              2. Slightly undercook vegetables and pasta to prevent excessive
              softening upon reheating.
              <br />
              3. Use caution when doubling spices; start with moderate quantities
              and adjust to taste.
              <br />
              4. Allow dishes to cool fully before storing.
              <br />
             5. Divide into smaller portions for efficient reheating and reduced
              food waste.
              <br />
              6. Use airtight containers or freezer bags to prevent freezer burn.
              <br />
              7. Label containers with recipe names, preparation dates, and
              reheating instructions. Certain foods (fried items,
              high-water-content fruits/vegetables, or mayonnaise/yogurt-based
              sauces) are less freezer-friendly.
              <br />
              8. Batch cooking for mixed-dish meals also suits weeks with lighter
              schedules, enabling preparation of freezer-friendly meals for
              busier weeks.
              <br>
              9. Think to invest in a big freezer
